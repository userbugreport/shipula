Make **works-on-cloud** as easy as _works-on-my-machine_.

Programming node servers, whichever frameworks you use like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Koa](https://koajs.com/), or just a raw port server, sooner or later you need to ship it.

Then you are going to find out you need to know a lot more things than just [node](https://nodejs.org), things like:

[Docker](http://docker.com)
| [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com)
| [ALB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)
| [Route53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html)
| [ACM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html)
| [IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)
| [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html)
| [ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html)
| [CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html)
| [CloudBackup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html)
| [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)
| [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html)
| [AWS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html

It's a lot to take in, and in most team settings, it ends up being a dedicated person to help everyone else out.
But what you really want to do is just **ship** -- so let's.

```shell
yarn global add @shipula/cli
```

or

```shell
npm install -g @shipula/cli
```

- yarn install -g @shipula/cli
- git clone git@github.com:userbugreport/shipula.git
- shipula deploy shipula/packages/express-sample
- ... wait ...
- curl
