# Intro

While you can certainly use yeoman -- I've set up the skeleton so you can clone and go, or fork and go.

This uses a very stock configuration, and out of the box has no packages created, so it builds, tests, lints and beautifies -- well -- nothing, because there is no code.

## Getting Started

- Fork or clone this repository.
- `cd` where you cloned it
- `yarn`
- `yarn test` -- should pass -- not a lot going on yet!
