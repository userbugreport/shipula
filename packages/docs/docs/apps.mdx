title: Supported Apps
---

Shipula is dedicated to publishing your Node packages with a `package.json` to the cloud.
So for some terms, any given Node _package_, when published, is an _app_.
Shipula supports dynamic apps, running Node programs that serve HTTP, as well as static site generators via CDN.

## Node Services

Any Node service is supported with the following rules:

- You have a Node HTTP serving program you want on the cloud, using tools like [Express] or [Koa]
- That node program listens on a `${PORT}` you can read from an environment variable.
- It needs to have a start script, what you do with `npm start` or `yarn start`
- It needs to have its `dependencies` and `devDependencies` correct
  - Easy way to tell -- make a new directoy, clone from git `npm install` or `yarn` -- then start

If you need to **build** your service before it starts, say you are using [TypeScript] -- just configure a [prepublish] script in your package.json.
This is the nearest thing to a 'standard' for packge publication, so we followed along.

## Static Site Generators

Static site generators, like Docusaurus or Create React App are a bit different -- there is no 'server' at run time.
Shipula takes care of this by publishing your files using a global content distribution network.

### Docusaurus

This one is my personal favorite, not just a documentation engine, but a great static site generator, simple blog platform, and uses MDX.

Publishing a Docusaurs site with `shipula` is straighforward, just type

```shell
shipula deploy <path_to_package>
```

Shipula will autodetect Docusaurus by looking for a `docusaurus build` in your `package.json`.

## Stacks

A Stack is an end to end copy of your App, you can have as many Stacks of your App as you like, including Static Apps.

### Prod/Stage/Test/Dev

It's really common to need multiple copies of your app. Setting up multiple copies can be _work_ -- depending on which cloud tools you use, it can be as much work each time. And deploying to each copy can be work.

Shipula deals with this by letting you set up multiple Stacks of your App.
Each Stack is a complete, isolated copy.
Make as many as you like, you just `npx shipula --stack stackName deploy appName`.

## Shared Files

One of the crazy differences between the cloud and your laptop is the file system -- or lack of it.
Normally on a cloud, the file system on each of your server containers is a transient thing, not for long term storage at all.
This isn't how you work locally. Your disk is -- your data!

Locally -- you can just write to your disk, files, yaml, json, sqlite -- all just works.
On the cloud, by default your find that while you might have a local disk, it's isn't **a** local disk, it's a disk per server/virtual machine/container, and it is going to get deleted when your server/vm/container goes away.

Shipula deals with this by setting up a shared file system that you can always reach at `/cluster_shared`.
Store files, have fun.
