Title: scale
---

Set scaling limits on your App.

The big thing to think about here is cost, and that's really a factor of how many copies, and how big each copy is in terms of CPU and RAM.
Shipula let's you set:
* Minimum Copies
* Maximum Copies
* CPUs per Copy
* RAM per Copy

Within these ranges, Shipula will autoscale, not going below your min or above your max.

The load balancer will spread requests over each of your copies.
