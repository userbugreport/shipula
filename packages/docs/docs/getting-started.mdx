:::tip Shipula's Goal
Be the simplest way to get your node server to the cloud
:::

Programming node servers, whichever frameworks you use like [Express] or [Koa], or just a raw port server, sooner or later you need to ship it.

Then you are going to find out you need to know a lot more things than just [node], things like:

[Docker] 
| [AWS]
| [ALB]
| [IAM]
| [S3]
| [ECS]~[ECR]~[FarGate]~[EKS]~[Kubernetes]
| [CloudWatch]
| [CloudFormation]~[CDK]~[Terraform]~[AWSCLI]

It's a lot to take in, and in most team settings, it ends up being a dedicated person to help everyone else out. But what you really want to do is jsut **ship** -- so let's.


-- shell 'movie' here --
* clone our sample
* yarn
* run local yarn start
* shell browser
* shipula
* shell browser to the cloud

### Assumptions
* You have a node http/https  you want on the cloud
* That node program listens on a `${PORT}` you can read from an environment variable
* You have signed up for AWS, and have `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* You can go to your shell and type `npx shipula deploy`

Yep -- that's it.
