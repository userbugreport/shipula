title: HTTPS
---

Shipula will take care of HTTPS for you, but you will need to help out a little bit.

1. You need to have your own domain name from a domain name provider.
2. You Shipula about your domain, which prepares DNS servers.
3. You tell your domain name provider the name servers Shipula creates.

## DNS Domain Name

Shipula will set up DNS servers for you, and this can be shared across many different services you run with shipula.

`shipula dns domain yourdomain.com`

This will set up a domain name server for the name you purchased, controlled by Shipula.

Shipula will tell you the the records you need to paste into your domain name provider to transfer the domain naming service.
Paste this into your domain name provider.

Shipula will then verify the domain is resolving properly and let you know when it is ready.

## Hostnames

With a Domain Name all set up, you can now assign host names to your shipula stacks like this:

`shipula dns name server.yourdomain.com <packageDirectory> [stackName]`

Shipula will then bind that host name and HTTPs certificate, and let you know when it is done.
