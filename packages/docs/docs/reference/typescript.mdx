Working with TypeScript, you should know about [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node).

This can be used in your `package.json` start script like:

```
...
"scripts": {
  "start": "ts-node index.ts"
}
...
```

So that you won't need to build in advance.

However, if you _do_ need to build in advance, shipula honors the npm standard `prepublish` script and will runit for you.

```
"scripts": {
  "prepublish": "tsc"
}
```

You can of course have your prepublish call another build script if you aren't using `tsc`.
