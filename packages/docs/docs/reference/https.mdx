title: HTTPS
---

Shipula will take care of HTTPS for you, but you will need to help out a little bit.

First -- you need to have your own domain name from a domain name provider.
Go get one of those now if you don't have one.

## DNS Domain Name

Shipula will set up a DNS server for you, and this can be shared across many different services you run with shipula.

`shipula dns domain yourdomain.com`

This will set up a domain name server -- the _end part_, which is the name you purchased.

Shipula will tell you the the records you need to paste into your domain name provider to transfer the domain naming service.
Paste this into your domain name provider.

Shipula will then verify the domain is resolving properly and issue a _certificate_ to use [HTTPS], and validate this.

## Hostnames

With a Domain Name all set up, you can now assign host names to your shipula stacks like this:

`shipula dns name server.yourdomain.com <packageDirectory> [stackName]`
