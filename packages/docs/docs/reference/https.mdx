title: HTTPS

Shipula will take care of HTTPS for you, but you will need to help out a little bit:

## hostname

Shipula needs to be told where it is in order to provsion a certificate for you, the way to do that is in your [package.json](./package.json#hostname).

## DNS 
Shipula will tell you the the cloud hostname to create a [CNAME] record with `npx shipula info`.
Paste this into your DNS provider.
